I refers to the the ability of machine to think & Freason like a human,2.5,"The student's answer provides a simplistic view of artificial intelligence, mentioning thinking and reasoning, which aligns loosely with the material, but lacks a comprehensive definition. The definition in the reference material discusses the broader concept of intelligent behavior and capabilities beyond just thinking like a human. Additionally, terms such as 'machine' are too vague and do not capture the nuance of the AI field as described in the literature.","['machine', 'think', 'reason', 'intelligent behavior']"
who is father of AI?,David Malan,1.0,"The student's answer is incorrect as David Malan is not recognized as the father of AI.
